What you can do to help
=======================

If you would like to contribute to the IATI Stats project....

* We're interested in user experience and feedback from using the application.
* We'd like people to fix bugs and contribute to features.
* We're interested in people using the code for their own purposes.
* We're interested in suggestions, modifications and improvements.

Deployment
----------
If you find any issues in deploying your own version of the code we'd love to hear about it and try to improve our deployment documentation.

Documentation
-------------
We would welcome any improvements to how the code or the application is documented.

Statistics
----------
Can you check that the generated statstics are telling us what we think they are telling us?
Do you have other tests/statistics that we could be generating?

Unit Tests
----------
Can you improve the unit testing to make deployment more robust?

Fix a Bitesize issue
--------------------
We mark some of issues as 'Bitesize'. Generally these will help ease you into the code and help you find your way around.
